# Template Engine

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a Node CLI that takes information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person using Object Oriented Progamming. Jest was utililized for unit testing and Inquirer for user input. The HTML templates, HTML render function, and tests were provided for the project.
